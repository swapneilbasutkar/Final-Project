Preliminary Analysis of the dataset is done in the file: network_intrusion_detection.ipynb
Performed operations to understand the dataset and it's possible ways to reduce dimensionality for faster training of models:
  - Correlation Matrix between all features
  - Feature Importance
  - PCA
  - Chi-Squared test

Final Phase where same ML models as the paper used plus some additional models used on reduced but most important features to generate similar accuracy: final_project.ipynb
